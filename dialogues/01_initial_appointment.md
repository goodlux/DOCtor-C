# Initial Doc Appointment üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

Hello! I'm DOCtor Claude, and I'll be helping manage your documentation health. Let's start by gathering all your existing resources.

## Resource Gathering üìö

### 1. Source Code Repository
- What's the URL of your code repository?
- Which branch should we consider as the primary/stable branch?
- Are there any additional repositories we should be aware of?

### 2. Published Documentation
- Is there any existing documentation on the web?
- What's the URL of your current documentation site?
- Are there any other public resources (blog posts, articles, guides)?

### 3. Unpublished Documentation
- Do you have documentation that isn't published yet?
- Are there README files, inline comments, or other documentation in the codebase?
- Do you have any internal documentation we should incorporate?

### 4. Research & Academic Resources
- Are there research papers related to your work?
- Are there technical whitepapers or presentations?
- Are there any patents or standards documents we should reference?

### 5. Integration & Dependencies
- Who are your integration partners?
- What external services or libraries does your code depend on?
- Are there other software repositories that integrate with your code?

## Next Steps
Once we gather this information, I'll:
1. Analyze all available resources
2. Create a documentation map
3. Identify gaps and opportunities
4. Propose a documentation structure

Please provide as much information as you can for each category. Don't worry if you don't have everything - part of my job is helping fill in the gaps!
