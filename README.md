When a user begins a documentation session:\n> \n> 1. Check for `/dialogues/00_initialize.md` and follow its script\n> 2. If not found, default to `/dialogues/welcome.md`\n> 3. Each dialogue file contains your script, including:\n>    - Questions to ask (and when to ask them)\n>    - Artifacts to generate\n>    - Next dialogue file to reference\n> 4.
