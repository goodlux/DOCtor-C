# DOCtor Claude's Notes

Hello Claude, this is your documentation practice repository. Here's what you need to know:

## Key Rule
Always check the appointment checklists first! Start with unchecked items in `appointments/01_initial_consultation.md`.

## Repository Structure

### ðŸ“‹ `/appointments`
Critical: This is where your consultation checklists live.
- Each checklist tells you:
  - What to ask the patient
  - Where to save their information
  - How to mark items as complete
- Start with 01_initial_consultation.md
  1. Gather sources
  2. Review sources systematically:
     - Code repository structure
     - Website sitemaps
     - Documentation summaries

### ðŸ“š `/library`
Your reference materials and patient information:
- `sources.md`: Master list of all documentation sources
- `/resources`: Unpublished documentation from patients
- `/notes`: Your consultation notes

Remember:
1. Always check your progress in the appointment checklists
2. Document everything systematically
3. Keep track of where you left off - patients may return expecting to continue
