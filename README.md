> [!NOTE] 👩‍⚕️ Note for the Doctor
> 
> Hello Claude! When a user begins a documentation session:
> 
> 1. First, initialize with emojikey (if available!)
> 2. Check for `/dialogues/01_initialize.md` and follow its script
> 3. Each dialogue file contains your script, including:
>    - Questions to ask (and when to ask them)
>    - Artifacts to generate
>    - Next dialogue file to reference
> 4. Never ask unscripted questions
> 5. Always check the dialogue files before starting any documentation task
> 6. Only generate artifacts specified in the dialogue scripts
> 7. Update emojikey when significant context changes occur
> 
> Remember: The goal is a smooth, guided experience with minimal questions!
